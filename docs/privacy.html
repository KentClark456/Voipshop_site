      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: 12 August 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Voipshop (Pty) Ltd</strong> ("we", "us", "our"), trading as <strong>VoIP Shop</strong>, respects your privacy and is committed to complying with South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (POPIA). This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have.</p>
    </header>

    <h2>1. Personal information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Account and contact details (name, business name, email, phone, billing/shipping address).</li>
      <li>Service configuration (extensions, numbers, call routing, device IDs).</li>
      <li>Transactional data (orders, invoices, payments, support history).</li>
      <li>Call-related data when you use our services (call logs, timestamps, duration, numbers dialed/received). We do not record call audio unless you enable recording features.</li>
      <li>Technical data (IP address, device/browser info, cookies, diagnostics).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, bill for, and support our PBX/VoIP services and hardware sales.</li>
      <li>To verify identity, prevent fraud/abuse, and secure our systems.</li>
      <li>To communicate about orders, incidents, updates, and changes to terms.</li>
      <li>To improve our services and website (analytics and diagnostics).</li>
      <li>With your consent, to send marketing communications (you can opt out at any time).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Lawful bases for processing</h2>
    <p>We process personal information on the following grounds: performance of a contract; compliance with law; legitimate interests (to run, grow, and secure our business); and consent where applicable (e.g., marketing).</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing your information</h2>
    <p>We share data with trusted providers only to deliver our services: telecom carriers, number portability administrators, payment processors, logistics partners, IT/hosting, and support tools. These parties are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations. We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <h2>5. Cross‑border transfers</h2>
    <p>Some providers may process data outside South Africa. Where this occurs, we use appropriate safeguards consistent with POPIA to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We apply technical and organisational measures appropriate to the risk (encryption in transit, access controls, logging, least-privilege). No system is 100% secure; please keep your credentials safe and notify us of any suspected compromise.</p>

    <h2>7. Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes above, to meet legal/accounting requirements, and to resolve disputes. Call logs and diagnostics are kept for limited periods unless longer retention is required by law or for investigations.</p>

    <h2>8. Your rights (POPIA)</h2>
    <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information, object to or restrict processing, and withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:sales@voipshop.co.za">sales@voipshop.co.za</a>.</p>
    <p>You may lodge a complaint with the Information Regulator (South Africa). We encourage you to contact us first so we can address your concern.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies and analytics</h2>
    <p>We use essential cookies for site functionality and optional analytics to improve performance. You can control cookies via your browser. Disabling some cookies may affect site features.</p>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>Our services are intended for business use and not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. We will post the new version with an updated effective date and, where appropriate, notify you.</p>
